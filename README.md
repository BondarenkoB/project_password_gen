# Random Number Generator
  üñ•Ô∏èThis Python program generates random passwords based on user-defined parameters such as length,
use of special characters, numbers and letters. The program uses variables to store password parameters
and branching operators to handle different options for password options. Error handling is implemented to ensure the correctness of user input.

## How to Use
  :abcd: To use this program, simply run the **project_password_gen.py** file and follow the on-screen instructions.
You will be prompted to enter the desired length of your password, whether you want to use special characters,
numbers, and letters, or a combination of these options.

  The program uses lists and terms to generate a random password that meets the criteria 
specified by the user. Once the password is generated, it will be displayed on the screen for the user to view.
